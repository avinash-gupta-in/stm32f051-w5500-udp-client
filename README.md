## UDP Client Code for STM32+W5500
A simple UDP client example for Wiznet IO driver. Use Hercules as UDP server on the PC. This example uses static IP (no DHCP).
Edit the IP address of this client on file ethernet.c This UDP client will send simple hello world text message on UDP port number 5000.

The code is written to run on a STM32F051 ARM Cortex M0 MCU. The W5500 is attached to the SPI Port and shown in table below.

| W5500    | STM32   |
| -------- | ------- |
| MISO     | PA6     |
| MOSI     | PA7     |
| SCLK     | PA5     |
| SCS      | PA1     |
| RST      | PA0     |
| INT      | NC      |

NC=No Connection
SCS=Chip Select (Active Low)

To view the debug output of the program we need a USB to Serial convertor like FT232RL (3.3V Version only)
The debug messages comes out on the TX pin of the USART2 peripheral of the STM32F051. This is **PA2**.
The baud rate is 38400. User RealTerm to view the outputs.

You will need ![STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) (Free from ST Microelectronics) to compile, build, flash (burn) and debug this project.
